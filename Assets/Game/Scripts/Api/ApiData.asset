      <i>Letter from Sgt James Sheppard, 9th R.I.F.,
      to Mr James Allen, Joseph Street: 2nd September 1916:</i>

      

      <i>&ldquo;I
      am sorry to say that your son William James has passed the &ldquo;border line&rdquo;
      I have made enquiries from the boys of his company, and they state that Wm.
      James was lying out in &ldquo;No Man&rsquo;s Land&rdquo; &ndash; dead. Of course,
      one doesn&rsquo;t know whether to take this statement as correct or otherwise.
      However, seeing that you have</i> <i>not had any word of his being alive or
      a prisoner, I am afraid that there is little or no hope. When your son was
      alive, I saw him almost daily, and he was always the same, a happy, bright
      and cheery soldier. No doubt the news of his death has brought sadness to many
      of his chums. How much more must you and Mrs Allen, as well as his poor wife
      and children suffer. The NCO&rsquo;s and the men of his platoon, all the boys
      who knew him in B Company, join me in sending you their heart-felt sympathy.
      Sergeant Johnston also wishes to say how sorry he is that Wm. James has made
      the supreme sacrifice, and hopes that God in His goodness will, in your great
      hour of sorrow be gracious to you, his dear mother, wife and children.&rdquo;
      </i>

      

      James was well known in the community for his kind, Sympathetic
      and Christian nature. He was a member of Dr Crane&rsquo;s Crimson Star LOL

      since 1922. He was also a member of The Apprentice Boys of Derry Portadown

      retirement. He regularly attended Services at Seagoe Parish Church. James died
      on 19<sup>th</sup> December 1943 at over 80 years of age. By 1943 two of his
      daughters; Georgina and Susannah had emigrated to America. His son Joseph had
      died 22 years previously. James&rsquo; wife Susannah died on 9<sup>th</sup>

      10 Irwin Street\r\n\r\nJames was born in Lurgan in 1855. James&rsquo; Father
      Thomas Mighton was a famous Fifer, who on one occasion had fifed five Lambeg&rsquo;s
      from Maralin to Dromore.\r\n\r\nJames earned the medal and clasp of the 88<sup>th</sup>
      Foot Regiment, 1877-79. James enlisted in the Connaught Rangers on 17<sup>th</sup>
      October 1874. During his service he spent time at Colchester, Aldershot, Sligo,
      Athlone, South Africa and finishing up at Galway in 1880. In all he had six
      years active service and six years reserve service.\r\n\r\nLeaving Colchester
      for Mauritius Island, he took part in the campaign to subdue the Kaffir outbreak
      of 1878-79, and later fought against the Zulus in Zululand, South Africa. 
      The hardships experienced in these campaigns undermined his health and after
      a period in Natal Hospital he was invalided home.\r\n\r\n<i>&ldquo;Mr Mighton
      who holds the 1878-79 medal, recalled forced marches of 23 miles laden with
      100 rounds of ammunition, with full equipment, through rivers, swamps and forests
      and said that very often the sole means of subsistence of himself and comrades
      was 1IB of raw flour from which they mad pancakes. He was in Durban he said
      when the Prince Imperial arrived. The Prince, a fine man, was killed shortly
      afterwards by the Zulus. Speaking generally, he remarked that people now had
      a much more pleasant life than when he was young&rdquo;.</i>\r\n<b><i>Interview
      with the Portadown Times, August 1938</i></b>\r\n\r\nJames signed the Ulster
      Covenant at Portadown Town Hall and went on to join the 4<sup>th</sup> Portadown
      Battalion Ulster Volunteer Force.\r\n\r\nFor many years, James was employed
      as a Weaver with Spence Bryson and Co Ltd. He wove the first sheer cut of cloth
      ever manufactured by them. James also had experience in the printing trade
      as a compositor with the &lsquo;Protestant Watchman&rsquo;s Gazette, Lurgan&rdquo;.\r\n\r\nJames
      was one of the original Catch-My-Pal Committee members in Portadown and often
      spoke of the early days when the committee held meetings in an upper room in
      Bridge Street. James collected the first &pound;5 for the Catch-My-Pal Hall
      Building fund- the &lsquo;fiver&rsquo; being the outcome of an appeal made
      by him at a committee meeting of the Portadown and Banbridge Textile Society.
      He was also a member of the British Order Ancient Free Gardiners.\r\n\r\nJames
      was a widower, but he remarried on 6<sup>th</sup> September 1913 in St Mark&rsquo;s
      Church, Portadown to Martha Duke, daughter of William John Duke and sister
      of Teresa, Abby (Abigail) and Maggie (Margaret) of Irwin Street.\r\n\r\nThey
      had one daughter, Martha, who later married Herbert Loney and had a family.
      Private Herbert Loney served with the Reconnaissance Regiment during the 2<sup>nd</sup>
      World War.  \r\n\r\nJames&rsquo; wife Martha died on 10<sup>th</sup> November
